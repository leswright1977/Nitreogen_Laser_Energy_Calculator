Nitrogen Laser energy Calculator in JavaScript

This is a simple Nitrogen Laser energy Calculator written in JS.
Just download the HTML fiel in src and open with a browser.

It is designed for use with data retreived from Pyroelectric energy sensors such  as the Gentec ED-100A, and Home Made Notrogen Lasers.

Simply enter:

The sensitivity of your detector in Volts per Joule. 
The peak voltage read off of an Oscilloscope in mV.
The pulse width of the Laser source in nanoseconds. (TEA Lasers will run at less than <800ps (0.8ns) depending on channel length)
The repetion rate of the source.
